# Phoenix the unofficial guide

This repo will contain everything that is hard to figure out regarding phoenix, from docker deployments, through continuous integration to server instrumentation. Since this contains a lot of outside services, it can't be included in the official docs.

The idea behind this document is to have a standard way of doing things, so that everybody doesn't have to re-invent the wheel over and over again.

## Deployment

- Heroku

[There is a great guide in the phoenix docs for heroku deployment](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/heroku.html)

- [Single machine deployment with docker](/deployment/docker.md)

- Kubernetes deployment

[Here is a great reference for now](https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/elixir-phoenix-on-kubernetes-google-container-engine)

the caveat being that the deployed nodes aren't connected in the erlang sense

## CI-CD integration

Cirlce CI offers a large free plan with 1500 minutes (for now at least)

- [CircleCI](/CI-CD/circleci.md)

## Instrumentation

Prometheus has a pretty good integration with phoenix, and is fairly easy to set up.
